### Functionality 

### 🏫Students and Teachers🏫

Initially, after registration you are signed up as a Student.
You can check all the courses which are "Upcoming" or have already started, "Active".
Teachers are there to teach... They can create their own courses, setting a future starting
and ending date.📅
They cannot make course which is with earlier date than the current day, as it doesn't make sense.
How to become a teacher?
Only an administator can change the classification of users.
This role has every permission, and it allows you to do everything.
If you want to check the features, you can seed an admin profile.

### 📖Learning Courses📖

Learning courses are created by teachers. Every created course is in "Upcoming" stage, as 
it is to begin in the near future. Clicking on a course, you can see all the enrolled students, as
well as, the course teacher.
Only students can join a course. If there are any issues with the enrolled users, the admin can
kick anybody from it and let the user enroll in it again.
When the course reaches its ending date, it becomes "Completed".
If the course itself has errored, admin can simply change its status to "Errored".

### 📁 Profile 📁

You can check your profile, where you can see your roles and the courses you have participated in with link to them.
